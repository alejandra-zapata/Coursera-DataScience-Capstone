### Introduction: Business Problem

In this project, we will try to find an optimal neighborhood for opening a restaurant. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a restaurant in **San Francisco**, California.

There are lots of restaurants in San Francisco. We will try to detect locations that are already crowded with restaurants as an indicator of high demand. At the same time, we are also particularly interested in opening a cuisine not frequently found in the city. 

We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area, such as its average rent prices, will also be taken into account so the best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.

### Data 

The following data sources will be used in the project:

1. **Relational Database: Average Rent in San Francisco, CA By Neighborhood.**
    
    Source:  https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-francisco/
    
    This data will be used throughout the project for different purposes. For example, finding the coordinates of each neighborhood, mapping those coordinates, and finding the best possible neighborhoods based on their average rent prices.
    
    
2. **Foursquare API.**

    Documentation: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs
    
    With this API, we'll get location data of the different neighborhoods in San Francisco.
