# Coursera-DataScience-Capstone

### Introduction/Business Problem

Known for being one of the most beautiful cities in the United States, San Francisco is also known for its highly expensive housing. 

My friend has communicated with me that she wants to move to the city, but she has a budget and needs my help as a data scientist. She wants to find a place that is affordable, and it is also surrounded by venues that are interesting to her. She loves good coffee, art, and hiking. 

In this project, I'll use different data sources and knowledge to find a perfect place for my friend. 

### Data 

I'll be using the following data throughout the project: 

1. GeoJSON file that marks the boundaries of the different neighborhoods in San Francisco. This file was provided in the Data Visualization course. https://cocl.us/sanfran_geojson 
  
  With this data source, I'll create map visualizations. 

2. Average Rent in San Francisco, CA By Neighborhood. https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-francisco/

  This data will work to find the neighborhoods that match my friend's rent budget. 

3. FourSquare API. 
  
  With this API, I'll find the venues that are most interesting to my friend based on the neighborhood selected. Ultimately,     helping to find the perfect place!
